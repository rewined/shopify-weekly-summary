# ðŸ“§ Sophie's Email Response System

Sophie can now intelligently respond to emails! When someone replies to her weekly analytics reports, she:
1. Reads and understands the email
2. Checks if fresh data is needed
3. Generates a helpful, conversational response
4. Sends it automatically

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### Automatic Processing
The system checks for new emails every hour and processes them automatically:
- Incoming emails are parsed and analyzed
- Sophie generates contextual responses using Claude AI
- Responses are sent immediately
- All conversations are saved to her memory

### What Sophie Can Handle

1. **Data Requests**
   - "How are we doing this week?"
   - "What are the current numbers?"
   - "Show me today's sales"
   
2. **Follow-up Questions**
   - "What happened with that spike you mentioned?"
   - "Can you explain the Boston numbers?"
   - "Why did conversion drop?"

3. **Preference Updates**
   - "Focus more on workshop data"
   - "Track candle library items closely"
   - "Send reports on Tuesdays instead"

4. **General Conversation**
   - Thanks and acknowledgments
   - Clarification requests
   - Business context updates

## ðŸ’¬ Response Examples

### Example 1: Data Request
**You:** "Hey Sophie, how are we doing this week compared to last?"

**Sophie:** 
```
Hi Adam,

Just pulled the latest numbers for you! We're at $32,450 this week 
compared to $28,500 last week - that's a 14% improvement! 

Charleston is leading the charge with $24,300 (up from $21,000), while 
Boston jumped from $7,500 to $8,150. The momentum is definitely building.

Want me to dig deeper into what's driving the growth?

Best,
Sophie
```

### Example 2: Preference Update
**You:** "Thanks Sophie! Can you track workshop attendance more closely going forward?"

**Sophie:**
```
Hi Adam,

Absolutely! I'll make workshop attendance a key focus in my reports. 
I'll track not just the numbers but also look at patterns - which 
workshops are most popular, occupancy rates, and week-over-week trends.

Is there anything specific about workshops you want me to analyze? 
Like time slots, instructors, or types of workshops?

Thanks,
Sophie
```
