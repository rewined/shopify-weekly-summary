## üí¨ How It Shows in Her Emails

### Without Memory (Old Way):
```
Hey Adam,

Hope you're having a good Monday! I've been looking at this week's numbers...

Charleston hit $28,500 in revenue this week. That's 82% of our $34,627 goal.
```

### With Memory (New Way):
```
Hey Adam,

Following up on last week when you asked about the candle library performance - 
I dug deeper into those SKUs this week and you were right, they're really picking up!

Charleston improved from $25,200 last week to $28,500 this week (up 13%!). 
Remember how we were at 73% of goal? We jumped to 82% this week. The workshop 
attendance you were curious about also increased - we had 47 attendees vs 32 last week.
```

## üîÑ Continuous Conversation Examples

### Week 1 Email:
> "I noticed Charleston's candle library items are trending up. The CF1020203 scent 
> sold 24 units this week - is that a new product?"

### Your Reply:
> "Yes, that's our new seasonal scent. Keep tracking it closely."

### Week 2 Email:
> "You asked me to track that new seasonal scent (CF1020203) - it's up to 31 units 
> this week! 29% increase. Should I keep monitoring this one specifically?"

### Week 3 Email:
> "Quick update on your seasonal scent - maintaining strong sales at 28 units. 
> It's now our #3 seller for three weeks running."
